<p>The data set contain averaged measurement of the mean and standard deviation of 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity acquired at a constant rate of 50Hz in an experiment performed on 30 people in the age range of 19-48.</p>
<p>In the processed data set, the mean and standard deviation of 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were averaged for several measurements on each subject and for different activities.</p>
<p>The subject IDs is an integer number in the range of [1, 30] and the activity list for each subject is:</p>
<ul>
<li>'STANDING',</li>
<li>'SITTING',</li>
<li>'LAYING',</li>
<li>'WALKING',</li>
<li>'WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS',</li>
<li>'WALKING_UPSTAIRS'</li>
</ul>
<p>The data were acquired by &quot;Smart Lab&quot; group (www.smartlab.ws) and can be downloaded from the following link:</p>
<p>http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones</p>
<p>The provided datasets were splitted into two training (70%) and test datasets (30%). In the current cleaned dataset provided with this CodeBook, the original training and testing datasets were combined together to have all the data in a single data set. Then only the measurements containing mean (mean()) or standard deviation (std()) were selected. The variables for each subject and each activity are the average of several measurements.</p>
<p>In the following, the information about the original datasets and the method used for measuring and extracting different variables were described by authors of the datasets.</p>

<p>The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.</p>
<p>The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.</p>
<h1 id="for-each-record-it-is-provided">For each record it is provided:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.</li>
<li>Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.</li>
<li>A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.</li>
<li>Its activity label.</li>
<li>An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="feature-selection">Feature Selection</h1>
<p>The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).</p>
<p>Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).</p>
<p>These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:<br />'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.</p>

<li>tBodyAcc-XYZ</li>
<li>tGravityAcc-XYZ</li>
<li>tBodyAccJerk-XYZ</li>
<li>tBodyGyro-XYZ</li>
<li>tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ</li>
<li>tBodyAccMag</li>
<li>tGravityAccMag</li>
<li>tBodyAccJerkMag</li>
<li>tBodyGyroMag</li>

<li>fBodyAcc-XYZ</li>
<li>fBodyAccJerk-XYZ</li>
<li>fBodyGyro-XYZ</li>
<li>fBodyAccMag</li>
<li>fBodyAccJerkMag</li>
<li>fBodyGyroMag</li>
<li>fBodyGyroJerkMag</li>
</ul>
<p>The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:</p>

<li>mean(): Mean value</li>
<li>std(): Standard deviation</li>
